      <h2>Every idea <span><img src="./assets/img/idea.png" alt="Licht"></span> starts with a need</h2>
      <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract
        more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my
        cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw
        that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the
        problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>
